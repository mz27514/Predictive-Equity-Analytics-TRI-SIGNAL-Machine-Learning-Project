# Predictive-Equity-Analytics-TRI-SIGNAL-Machine-Learning-Project
Equity price prediction machine learning models are hindered by presence of noise in data which degrades performance. Noise in external data sets or contained in a data lake presents an additional challenge. Practitioners can use TRI-SIGNAL Signals {1,2,3} data set to overcome the effects of noise in equity price series on machine learning models as starting data set to create predictive models with consistent high predictive power. Create customized predictive equity models by combing additional external data sets with TRI-SIGNAL Signals {1,2,3} for causality attribution modeling or to create complex deep learning machine learning models.
